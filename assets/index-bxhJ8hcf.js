His description is auburn hair a little curly or reddish, sandy complexion very freckled and about five feet nine or ten inches tall. I think if the State papers would insert an item of inquiry and the pastors publish it from the pulpit, it might benefit some of this relatives. I was called in the case, but could not swear to his being [undecipherable] as I did not know any of his people. Attend to this immediately as the case will, I think go to the jury next week, but whichever side is defeated I think they will appeal. Respectfully Mrs WILLIAM MARTIN"},{id:1286,title:"D. J.

It was a surprise to the son, and the aged woman had traveled night and day to aid their benefactor in carrying out his plan of a "Christmas gift of a mother," long believed by him to be dead. She brought him a simple present, a few magnolias, symbolic of the South, where she had suffered so much, but which she still loved. Young's Romantic CareerDowen Young, the colored man who fondled the withered hand of his mother as she lay upon a sofa, too much exhausted to stand, and too happy to sleep, is a doorkeeper at the main entrance to the stock exchange, where he has been for four years. He is now about 48 years of age, and married, and he had not heard from any member of his family since he was eight years old, though for years he tried to get some trace of his mother; but, hearing she was dead some years ago, he gave up hope, and when his soldier friend, who had never lost track of him, told him he would some day help him find her, it was without hope that he listened and thanked him. The incidents in the life of the three chief figures in this drama are a story breathing of the cruelties of slavery, the inhumanity of men, the circumstances of war, the abiding affection between a [indecipherable] mother and her son, and the stranger, but true friendship of a generous man for a little slave to whom he gave freedom.When the civil war broke out Margaret Young, a negro woman, and her three children lived on the Arthur estate in Clay county, Missouri, near the town of Liberty. They were all slaves of John Arthur. Her husband, Jesse Young, had died a few years before. He belonged to Mrs. Arthur, whose maiden name was Young, and was one of the many human chattels that made up her dower. Margaret had been the slave of a neighboring planter, Adam Pence, and she was known as Margaret Pence. In 1854 John Arthur bought her from Pence, and she was married to Jesse Young. They had three children, Dowen, Walter, and Susie. In 1861 it became apparent to the slave owners of the Missouri counties bordering on the Kansas line that, in order to save the value of their slaves, they must sell them off to the traders who supplied the Southern markets. Many of the negroes had run away, being assisted in escaping by one Fred Fritzlein, a mulatto. His particular field of operations was the Arthur and adjoining plantations. John Arthur therefore sought for and found a purchaser for his able-bodied men and women slaves in one Jim Adams, a noted dealer in negroes. Margaret had longed and hoped for freedom. Many of her fellow servants had made their escape, but she could not desert her little ones, not realizing that she might at any time be forced to separate from them, and doomed to a life of toil in the Southern cotton fields. Mother and Children Separated.Margaret was sold to the slave trade, and separated from her children, the eldest 8 years, and the youngest a girl 3 years of age. "And how we cried, mother," said the oldest son to her yesterday, "when they took you away."She was joined to the slave gang, chained and guarded to prevent their escape, which started by a circuitous route to avoid Union soldiers to the South. After much roundabout traveling, Adams reached Arkansas, and was soon inside the Confederate lines, where he was perfectly safe. From there he hurried on by direct route to New Orleans, which was the best slave market. From the block in the slave pens of that city he sold his gang. Margaret was among them, and described in the catalogue as follows: Margaret: prime: Christian: 26She was sold to Dr. Walter Mathews for $1,800. It was the value slave dealers placed upon Christian slaves and so advertising them moved Whittier to say: A Christian! going: gone! Who bids for God's own image? for his grace Which that poor victim of the market-placeHath in her suffering won?Boys Join Northern Army.After the sale of the mother the children were placed with an old auntie, and as soon as they were strong enough put to work in the hemp and corn fields. It was while the two boys were so employed that Colonel Jennison, the famous Kansas Jayhawker, rider and raider and a terror to all the border slave-owners, and a company of troopers made one of their periodical forays into Clay county and, reaching the Arthur plantation, gathered in a few thoroughbred horses and five boys, carrying them off to the steamboat landing near by. The women of the Arthur household followed, and at the landing pleaded with the boys to return, but freedom was now very plainly in sight for them, and they refused. The boat was steaming up stream and Dowen and Walter Young met his friend and benefactor, who was a sergeant major of the regiment to which the troopers belonged. After they arrived at Fort Leavenworth the boys attached themselves to an Illinois regiment, and soon became very useful. In this same summer of '64 Price, the Confederate general, planned his last raid into Missouri, entering the state below Pilot-Knob, and menacing St. Louis. The Illinois regiment was ordered to that point, and later down the Iron Mountain road. The little negro boys made the campaign, and remained with the regiment until it was mustered out at Camp Butler, Springfield, Ill. One of the boys, Walter, went to Oquawka, Ill., with Captain John Wilson, but from there all trace of him has been lost.Came to Chicago in '68Dowen was taken from Springfield to Ottawa, Ill., where he was provided with a home in the family of the late John H. Manley. In 1868 he came to this city, and has lived here ever since. He has always had employment, being a quiet, sober, industrious man. Many years ago he identified himself with the Bethel African M. E. Church. He also belongs to the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, Western Star lodge, No. 1,443. He was for three years janitor of the Jones school on Plymouth place, and twelve years behind the oyster bar in the restaurant of the old Burke's European hotel.Susan, the sister, remained with the Arthur family for some time after they removed to Kansas City. She is now 41 years of age, and until this year has never heard from any member of her family, but through the same benefactor, she will soon see her now aged mother again.After the mother had been sold, she remained in New Orleans about two years, when she was taken to Mobile, Ala. where she has lived ever since. For years she has longed for some word from home, from the old place, and the three little children that she had left there. She could not read nor write, for it had been a crime to teach a slave to read even the Bible.She married again, and the new cares of a growing family helped the years to slip away. Many Christmas days have come and gone since she, then a young woman, commenced her new life in the South. Mature womanhood came, and then age, and the old, old times and her former home in Missouri seemed like a dream to her. A few weeks ago the family by whom she is occasionally employed read in their evening paper that information of a person answering her description was wanted. She had the inquiry answered, was sent for, and proved to be the long-lost Margaret Young, mother of Dowen, Walker, and Susie Young.Mother and Son Meet.Thursday last at midnight Mrs. Nelson, for that is now her name, was put aboard the north-bound train in Mobile, Ala. She was going to visit her son Dowen in Chicago, and then after a few weeks to journey on to Kansas City, to visit her daughter, Mrs. Susan Reeves, and her brothers, who were sold about the same time, but returned North at the close of the war. She had a letter from the general agent of the Mobile and Ohio railroad at Mobile, addressed to conductors and porters, which insured her every attention. She reached Chicago at noon and was met by her benefactor, who took her immediately to her son's home. Dowen Young had been apprised of his friend's intention to visit him Christmas day, and when he saw him from his window walking toward the house he did not take much notice of the tall colored woman behind him. She followed into the room. "Dowen, do you know this woman?" asked his friend. (Continued on 2nd.

Mr. AbrahamBlackburn, a colored man 35 years old, hadbeen in the employ of the late Rev. JohnForsyth D.D., since March, 1878. He hasalways been sober, industrious, and reliable.Added to this Abraham is intelligent andcourteous. In August 1862, Abraham, his mother, threesisters, and three brothers were sold into Rich-mond, VA., to Andrew Blackburn, a large slave-holder. They were by him carried to NewMarket, Jefferson County, Tenn. AbrahamBlackburn, was a mere boy. At NewMarket the children were all separated fromtheir mother, she being sold again. From NewMarket Blackburn, the purchaser, took thechildren to Henderson County, North Carolina,where they were one by one separated from eachother, Abraham reaching the North someyears ago. The mother was never seen orheard from by any of her children until lastnight.From the time Abraham reached the estateof manhood he has felt a keen interest in thewelfare of his mother, and has long wanted tofind out where she was and to see her. Of lateyears, he has adopted various plans which hethought would lead to the restoration of hismother to him. For the last four years andsix months this dutiful son has been follow-ing up every clew that he had a idea wouldlead to the learning of his mother's where-abouts. He failed repeatedly, until yesterday.Then he received a letter from his agedmother's own hand. It now transpires thatthe mother has resided in Knoxville, Tenn.,ever since the close of the War of the Rebellion.During the long search 236 letter have beenwritten with the hope of finding this youngman's mother. That there will be rejoicingwhen the reunited mother and son meet goeswithout saying. The mother is alone in theSouth, except for a sister Eliza, who resides atRichmond, Va. Abraham has written a letterto his mother expressing the wish that she comehere and spend the winter, and then she cango back South, if she so desires, in the spring.There appears to be no doubt that the motherwill avail herself of the invitation extendedby her dutiful son, and that she will reachNewburg at an early date. Of the childrenwho were sold with Abraham Blackburn, atRichmond, in 1862, the latter has track still ofthe following: William, who is (younger) atSyracuse, N.Y.:  Mary (older) in South Car-olina: Clara, in Rutherford County, SouthCarolina.It is the purpose of Abraham Blackburn toremain at the house of the widow of Dr. For-syth during the the coming winter, where he willbe an able assistant, as he always was, to theRev. Dr. Forsyth, who valued his services veryhighly. In conversation with Abraham, ittranspires that Dr. Forsyth did good workduring the last few years in assisting the formerin his search for his mother. And the youngman speaks in high praise of his late employerfor the benevolent and kindly interest he tookin assisting him in this direction. Above all,Abraham returns his grateful thanks to Godfor reuniting him with his mother whom heloves so well. -- Newburg (N.Y.)

The War came, and before it was over, George ran off, got into the Union lines, and became a soldier for his country and race's liberty. At its close he settled in Indiana, and a few years ago came here. Today he chanced to step into the Wabash Depot, and while there was electrified and almost struck dumb to find his sister, now Mrs. Petrin, and her husband and his old mother, both of whom he had not seen or heard of for a third of a century, and who he supposed were dead.

Among them wereMrs. Bashop and her 12-year-old daughterPatience. "She was a bright little girl,"said Mrs. Bashop yesterday, "and when wewere taken into the market-place to be sold Iprayed that wherever we might go we wouldgo together." But her wish was not to befulfilled. She was sold first and Ben Davis, aprofessional negro trader, bought her. Thelittle girl was sold to a stranger. Mrs. Bashopfell on her knees before Davis andimplored him to buy her daughter fromthe stranger.

Mrs. Bashop was carried to Charlestown, S.C., and sold again.That was in 1859, and already the rumblings of the coming war were heard. Slaves changed masters rapidly then, and Mrs. Bashop was sold from one to another, passing into Alabama and Mississippi, being owned at Carrollton in the latter state when emancipation came. But during all her involuntary wanderings she had no thought but of her lost daughter, Patience. She begged each master to write back to Charles City Court-house, Va., and endeavor to discover something of her. Some complied, others did not, but no news ever came of the missing girl. When she was free Mrs. Bashop began the search on her own account. For a long time she could not away from Mississippi. She could earn but little money; not enough to take her back to Virginia, where her daughter had been sold, but she wrote letters and friends wrote others for her.At last she saved money enough to reach Virginia, but the visit increased only her sorrow. Her former master was dead and the war had swept away old landmarks and old recollections. No one knew anything of her daughter, she could not learn the name of the man who bought her, but the mother's heart was faithful still. She sewed and she cooked and she did housework. She denied herself to save money for her search. She traveled through Virginia and she went through Kentucky. She visited South Carolina and the far South, and everywhere she hunted for her daughter. She put advertisements in the papers; she paid the colored preachers to state the case in their churches before their congregations, in order that one person might tell the story to another, and thus spread it through the country, but still no news came of the lost girl.

They met and "loved at first sight," and lived and cohabited together, as the beasts of the forest, without any legal preliminaries.

In the year above-mentioned, he met a beautiful and fascinating girl, whom he loved at "first sight." She, of course, returned his affections, and they were married, as all slaves were in those days. Two years later, the happy couple were sold on the block and separated. After the war had closed, and slavery extinguished, Mr. Bradley came to Ohio, and, supposing that his former "sweet heart" was dead, married another woman. This second wife died a short time ago, and Mr. Bradley was again alone in the world. A few days ago his former wife, whom he had not seen since 1859, by accident came here, and to her great surprise found her former husband. It was a sad though happy meeting.

She was sold from him in slavery and taken away among strangers, just as cruel fate had done for many others before, and every effort made by both of them to discover the other’s whereabouts since the war has been in vain until twenty one long years, only to find themselves gray haired and aged.

The father is a man of remarkable age and according to a son who recently visited here, has seen 127summers. Henry Tolliver, when but a boy of 9, was sold on a southern auct-ion [auction] block in Davis County, Mis-souri [Missouri]. This was the last he saw of his parent. He ran away fromhis master about the time of the outbreak of the war and came to Des Moines. He enlisted in the sixteenth United States colored infantry, served through the war and then came back to Des Moines and has since lived here. He is now a man of 64 years and the story of how he learned again of the whereabouts of his father reads like a romance.A short time ago a colored man—a tramp—came to Mr. Tolli-ver’s [Tolliver's] home on Fremont street. Mrs. Tolliver gave him some-thing [something] to eat. The visitor asked her name. Mrs. Tolliver told him. He said he knew an old man of that name living at Leavenworth and that he was known as Alfred Tolliver. Mrs. Tolliver said at once this was the name of her husband’s father. Mr. Tolliver was working south of the river at the time. Mrs. Tolliver kept the stranger until her husband returned, and the latter, after making minute in-quiries [inquiries], was assured he had at last discovered the whereabouts of his father. He wrote to Leav-enworth [Leavenworth] for confirmation and re-ceived [received] a reply that removed all doubt on the subject. Early this week Mr. Tolliver was visited by his brother Alex-ander [Alexander] of Tonganoxie, Kans. The two brothers had not met since 1862. From his brother Mr. Tol-liver [Tolliver] learned that his father was in good health and was able to walk about. He has planned to leave for Levenworth in a short time and there will doubtless be a family reunion well worth wit-nessing [witnessing]. While Alexander Tolliver was here this week the two brothers called on Capt. Amos Brandt at the state house and told him their remarkable story. Mr. Henry Tolliver had a son in Captain Brandt’s company of colored taoops in the Spanish-American war."},{id:3248,title:"Tom Carnahan, the only black police officer in Lincoln, NE, finds his brother after two decades",related_ads:["The McCook Tribune (McCook, NE)","Lincoln, NE","Texas","Arkansas","Other (Newspaper Article)"],tags:["Civil War","found","literacy","migration (north)","migration (post-emancipation)","migration (west)","sibling(s)"],transcription:"TOM CARNAHAN, the colored member of the Lincoln police force, has been treated to a genuine surprise by the arrival of his brother from Texas, whom he has not heard from in twenty years.

They were separated when he was 7 years old, he having been sold by their master, William Hobbston, in Kentucky, to Dr. Henderson of Osceola, Ark. When the war came on Easton ran away and fell into the care of soldiers. After the war he came to Indiana and worked for years at Rushville. He then removed to Indianapolis, working for three years at the stockyards.This was the story Easton told C. G. Kumler, foreman at the Nordyke-Marmon Works. As to the name of the town in Kentucky where Hobbston lived, all Easton could say was that it was something like Lovelace. Kumler became interested in the man’s search and learned that there was a Lovelaceville in Kentucky. He also got information that V. S. Lovelace lived there. Writing to him, he soon received a reply, in which Lovelace said he had been a resident there for fifty years, and knew many persons whom Easton had mentioned. Among those was Duke Robertson, who still remained on his old plantation on the south side of Mayfield Creek. Kumler asked Easton if he remembered the creek.“Yes.” replied Easton. “I can remember that. My mother used to wash the clothes in a creek and dry them on the bank, and I used to go swimming in it.”“What was the named of it?”“I can’t remember.”“If I told you could you remember it?”“Yes, I think I could; but am not sure.”“Well, was it Mayfield Creek?”“Yes, sir; that was it, and it had a bend in it called Walnut Bend, where I used to fish.Kumler then wrote again to Lovelace, inquiring about Clara Hobbston, as John called his mother. The answer of Mr. Lovelace was: “The woman you seek was Clara Clounch. Clara’s husband was and is William Hobbs, not Hobbston. She and Bill are both alive yet and live in Paducah, Ky. They had hard times during the war. They were living a mile from this place, peaceable, law-abiding citizens, but were awakened in the dead of night by bushwhackers. Bill was shot in his cabin and made a cripple for the balance of his life.”These letters from his old home aroused great hope in Easton’s breast. He could hardly wait for a letter to his mother to reach Paducah, and wanted to go immediately to her. Kumler, however, advised patience, and asked Easton if he had any particular mark by which he could be identified. “Yes, sir,” he said, “I was born with two thumbs, and one was cut away when I was about six weeks old. You can see the scar on my hand where it was.” It was by this scar the mother identified her son, who is with her in Paducah."},{id:3289,title:"Alexander Foley and his wife reunited and remarried after forty years",related_ads:["The Evening Bulletin (Maysville, KY)","Natchez, MS","Carrollton, KY","VA (Virginia)","Other (Newspaper Article)"],tags:["forced migration","found","reunion","slave trade","sold south"],transcription:"REUNITED.

His surprise could be imagined when he was told by Dr. Goslie that his wife who was sold from him forty years ago, was living in Carrollton. Mr. Foley told the following story: He had not been married long when his wife was sold and taken south, while he was sold to parties who took him further north. Neither could read or write, and as years rolled by he naturally thought that his wife died. Both, it developes, remarried, he settling in Virginia, while the wife settled in this city. Foley's second wife died a few years ago, as did his first wife's husband. Foley says divine providence brought them together, and he made himself known.

Special to Courier-Journal. That there are romances as touching in negro life as were ever told is proven by the story of a colored couple named Uncle Levi and Aunt Aggie, who lived in Cedartown Valley. In 1840 Levi belonged to Mr. Sparks, who then resided in Morgan county. In the same county lived Dr. E. E. Jones. Among Dr. Jones’ slaves was a fine looking mulatto girl, whoes smiles was courted by every young male slave in the community. She was named Aggie. Levi and Aggie met often at corn-shucking frolics. They were partners in the dance and play, and every Saturday night he would obtain a pass to visit her. Thus Levi wooed and Aggie was won. They married in 1843. “And I was so happy when I met every Saturday night to see my young wife,” said Uncle Levi. They had only been married a year when Mr. Sparks moved from Morgan to Polk county, carrying the broken hearted husband with him. After five or six years separation, believing they would never again see each other, Levi married one of his master’s women.“But, Boss, I never loved her like Aggie,” was the old man’s explanation. Aggie, too, married, and both raised a large family; but their thoughts often drifted to the past. Neither knew whether the other was living. At last came the down fall of the Confederacy and the freedom of slaves. Upon enquiry Uncle Levi found that his old love was still living and married. He went nobly to work for his second wife. Ten years ago Aunt Aggie’s husband died and left her without providers. News reached Uncle Levi, and he sent word to his old love to come and live with him and his wife. This Aunt Aggie refused to do. Years flew fast, and the boy and girl who sang and danced at the corn-shucking, who loved, married and were parted grew old with an aching void in their lives as its evening drew near. Two years ago Uncle Levi’s wife died, and after a few months mourning he went for Aunt Aggie. She went to her old love, and after a separation of forty years they were united. They return in part to days of their youth, and their love is young again. Everybody in the neighborhood has heard the sad story and they are recipients of many kindnesses. Aunt Aggie is now 60 and Uncle Levi is 70."},{id:3291,title:"Mrs. Mary A. Riker searching for her son Joseph A.

All were born in the fam-ily [family] of Daniel Kent, Maryland.INFORMATION WANTED of John Wesley Dorsey, born of Low Maller, Maryland, sold at 6 years from his parents, Milla and Nelson Daw-sey [Dawsey]. Any information concerning tlie above will gladly be received by Mrs MILLA DAWSEY, 262 Lexington st, East Boston.Mrs. Dawsey is trying to find her long separated brothers and son. The adver-tisement [advertisement] comes about 35 years after the freedom of the American negro slave, and shows that she herself was a slave. Back of this advertisement is a story that is pathetic. A mother looking for her child that was sold away from her in slavery over 45 years ago, and which she has never seen or heard of since; a sister looking for her long lost brothers, who, too, were sold away when children. Mrs Milla Dorsey is, as near as she can ascertain, about 72 years old, and has until very recently been living with her niece, Mrs John Coffee, at 262 Lexington st, East Boston. She has gone on a visit to her nephew, Thomas Isaacs, of [Indecipherable]12 Wayne st, Baltimore.Mrs Dorsey was born a slave on the Daniel Kent estate in Calvert county, Md. Her parents, Moses and Lina Bond, reared a large family, and as was customary upon nearly all of the plan-tations [plantations] of the south during the slave period, several of their children were sold to help carry on the estate. There was born to them Washington, James Lafayette, Joseph Henry, Queen Rebecca, Melinda Amphielia and Milla. These children were early scat-tered [scattered], and only after the close of the war and by the merest accident did Mrs Dorsey ever succeed in finding any. Of her brothers she has never heard. Her sisters she has met, and it is with their children that she spends the remain-der [remainder] of her days. According to the slave manner, she was married to Nelson Dorsey. At that time they were living in Low Mallow. Two children were born, a girl and a boy. The girl died and the boy lived, as far as Mrs Dorsey can recollect, to be about 6 years old, when he was sold to another master. The last that she saw of her only son was when his new mas-ter [master] was leading him away. Time passed and her husband died. Shortly after that she was sold and car-ried [carried] to Atlanta, Ga, where the breaking out of the war and the subsequent eman-cipation [emancipation] of the slaves found her.Hoping to reach her brothers and per-haps [perhaps] her son, Mrs Dorsay has taken to advertising for them in several papers.It is doubtful if she will ever be able to find her son or her brothers. If they are living, it is doubtful if they would recognize the names under which she is advertising for them. Slaves accepted any name which their masters chose to give them. When slaves were found on the plan-tations [plantations], at the time of the enumeration shortly after the war, many took their masters' names. Thus it may have hap-pened [happened] that Mrs Dorsey's son and broth-ers [brothers] may have taken the name of their last masters, and may have never known their own family name."},{id:3297,title:"Harriet Relf searching for her husband Quindy Relf",related_ads:["The Liberator (Boston, MA)","Martinsburg, Knox County, OH","Salem, Columbiana County, OH","Henry County, VA","Information Wanted Ad"],tags:["antebellum ad","escaped","free people of color","freed","literacy","manumitted","resistance","self-emancipation","spouse","white newspaper"],transcription:"INFORMATION WANTED.Quindy Relf, husband of Harriet Relf, is informed that his family, consisting of wife and five children, formerly belonging to Henry Fry, of Moorefield, Henry Co., Va., are living near Martinsburg, Knox Co., Ohio.

It appears that about fifteen years previous to the late civil war a colored man, who now gives the name of Anthony Edwards, and who was then married after the custom of those times, resided with his master in Pike County, Mo. From some cause not known to Edwardshis master sold him to a Southern planter, but retained possession of his wife and his former master and child. After the war he remarried, as did also his wife. His second wife dying, he drifted to St. Louis several years ago, and by a peculiar coincidence his wife, having lost her second husband, also came to the city, the daughter by the Pike County or slave marriage accompanying her. The daughter, having received some intimation that her father was in St. Louis, made indefatigable efforts to find him, and after about three years' search succeeded in locating him in Edwardsville. The result was a meeting between her father and mother, after separation of over thirty-five years. The sequel of this meeting was the appearance at the Recorder's office yesterday of the aged couple for the purpose of obtaining a marriage license. They gave their names as Anthony Edwards, aged 79 years, and Lucinda Gibson, aged 78 years. They looked remarkably vigorous and hearty, considering their ages, and still have before them a lease to several more years of life.

F. Camp at his office in Court place. The principals were John Thompson, aged eighty-five years, and Kitty Owens, aged seventy. Before the late war both were slaves in the family of Mr. George Girding, who owned a large plantation in Morgan county, Tennessee. At that time Thompson was looked upon as an old man, while the woman was called ‘mammy’ by the children in the family. After the two slaves were made free by the war they went out in different directions to make a livelihood. The man decided to follow the river, and he secured a place in the dining-room of a steamboat. He continued at this until several months ago, when he retired. Thompson had saved enough money to keep him in comfort the rest of his days. He looked up some of his children, now living in Louisville, but found that they did not appear to take any interest in their old father, not seeming to care whether he was alive or dead. It was while visiting his children that the old man met Kitty Owens. They did not know each other at first, and it was only after they had compared notes that the two recognized each other. A marriage was shortly arranged between the two. Yesterday they went to the County Clerk’s office together, where a license was secured. The two old people were accompanied to Magistrate Camp’s office by a curious crowd. Here the ceremony was performed. Thompson had been married three times, and his companion only one time less. As the old couple was leaving the office Magistrate Camp remembered then that his fee had been overlooked.“Lor! Yo’ Honah, I hasn’t got any mo’ money,” said the old man. The facial expression of the old darky underwent a complete change as he fumbled in his pockets. Finally, Thompson got a small amount of change out of his many pockets. This was given over to the Magistrate, who found it amounted to a total of ninety cents. The old man explained that he had divided his savings so they would last until he was one hundred years old. He took only one of these piles weekly, never touching the rest until the next week. The bridegroom said that he hoped to save enough out of the next few weeks’ allotment to pay the balance of $1.10 to the Magistrate. The old man and his bride were then allowed to depart happily for their home."},{id:3360,title:"Henry Myers is searching for Elijah Marrs",related_ads:["Appeal: A National Afro-American Newspaper (St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN)","Joliet, IL","Chicago, IL","Information Wanted Ad"],tags:["missing person(s)","railroad"],transcription:"ELIJAH MARRS--I would like to know the where-abouts [whereabouts] of Elijah Marrs formerly window man at the Grand Pacific.

During all these years, not having heard of his mother, he supposed her dead, but her memory was still bright, and he often thought of her as she must have suffered in the cotton-field under the lash of the cruel taskmaster. On Monday he was almost electrified at being told that an old woman, claiming to be his mother, was in the city in search of him, but the lapse of time had been so great that he was incredulous, but faint as the hope was, he determined to follow it, and see if it should prove delusive.  He went, as directed, to the house of his uncle Ed. Davis, and there met an old woman who clasped him in her arms, and wept over him as her son. To test the genuineness of her claim, Willis asked, "How do you know I am your son?" And the old woman gave her reasons, detailing facts that were known to him as having occurred.  He then showed her his right hand, and asked, "Can you tell how I lost that little finger?""Yes," replied she, "your young master cut it off while chopping a trough," and Willis accepted the evidence as much stronger than that of the traditional strawberry mark.The aged woman, after being sold to Alabama, was placed on a cotton farm, and worked as a field hand until the close of the war extinguished slavery. As soon as free, she determined to return, and worked to that end, but ill health several times interfered to prevent, and it was not until two weeks ago that she found her way to Lewisport, and subsequently to Owensboro, where she heard that her daughter was dead and her son, and brother, (Ed.  Davis), were in Evansville, and now, after a separation of twenty-eight years, the old and broken down woman has found her son, who rejoices at the reunion, and welcomes her to his humble home.'},{id:3546,title:"Martha Hicks searching for her husband Braham Hicks",related_ads:["The Tri-Weekly Standard (Raleigh, NC)","Raleigh, NC","Wake County, NC","Harnett County, NC","Information Wanted Ad"],tags:["missing person(s)","Reconstruction","white newspaper"],transcription:"NOTICE TO BRAHAM HICKS!I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM MY HUSBAND, Braham Hicks, since October, 1866.

The wrinkled and feeble old negress is the heroine of a romance. In antebellum days she was a slave and was owned by a planter near Asheville, N. C. At an early age she was married to a slave of the same master. By him she had several children. Over half a century ago her husband was torn from her and her children and was sold to another planter. The woman continued to work on the North Carolina plantation, and in a short time was again married. Her whole family was then put on the block and sold to a Virginia man. When the emancipation proclamation was promulgated the family took advantage of their freedom and journeyed northward, finally taking up their home in Louisville. The husband died after the close of the war, and the children one by one left their mother to seek their fortunes elsewhere. The mother toiled and labored to make a livelihood. She heard nothing of her first husband until about a month ago, when one of her sons found that the old man was living in Newport, Ky. The old negress journeyed thither and found the husband of her youth. He had also been married the second time and had several children by the second wife.

Ellen Johnson, the mistress of the house, told a very peculiar story. She said that fifty years ago she and her mother were slaves, owned by Mr. Ben Johnson, of Frankfort, Ky.

Mother and daughter of course did not recognize each other, but were overjoyed, nevertheless. The mother is 112 years old and her daughter 60.

Eli Baxter, a lawyer and planter, lived in Hancock county,  Georgia, not far from the town of Sparta. He own-ed [owned] 150 slaves, among the number, Fer-aby [Feraby], a full-blood African, who was the mother of three children, Amy, Will-iam [William] Eli, and George, who took the sir name of their owner, Baxter.When Amy was ten years of age, her young mistress married Dr. Carnell, and received Amy as a marriage pres-ent [present]. With her new master she lived four years, when, her young mistress dying, she was sold to Austin & Chism, slave dealers, for $700, and taken by them to Columbus, Georgia. She was then fourteen years of age, as near as she can recollect, and with oth-er [other] slaves that had been purchased was kept for two months in a slave pen, locked up to prevent their escape, and every day taken to the auction room in front of the building and offered for sale, and inspected by would-be pur-chasers [purchasers], as horses are examined by jockeys.At the expiration of this time she was sold for $900 to Hampton Smith, of Mobile, Alabama, with whom she lived three and a half years, and dur-ing [during] that time was married to Alfred Weiman, a slave of Smith's. They were during this time on a cotton plan-tation [plantation] in Wayne county, Miss.They did not get along well with the overseer, trouble ensued that resulted in her husband trying to kill the over-seer [overseer] with an axe. The row resulted in both of them being sold to a slave dri-ver [driver], the price paid for the woman being $1,000.They were taken to Decatur, Miss., and kept in a slave pen for two weeks, when they were sold to two different parties, but lived close together. Her new master, Walter Nimmax, was a merchant, and she lived with him but six months, when she and her mistress had some trouble that resulted in her mistress going for her with a rawhide, and being stood off by her slave with an axe.She ran away, and was secreted by her husband for three weeks in a large pile of cotton seed, into which she had made a tunnel, the mouth of which was filled up with cotton seeds. Her husband visited her at night and fur-nished [furnished] her food and water.During her concealment she was sold to David Gill for $1,100, and lived in his family for three months. Gill and family were piney wood white trash, had always been poor, could neither read or write, but by some streak of good luck became possessed of some money, and to be aristocratic, invested a portion in a slave, the first they or their ancesters had ever owned. She says they were poor, ignorant white trash, and she told them she would run away, and fearing the threat would be carried out, she was sold to two gamblers for $600.These sports took her to Little Rock, Ark., and sold her to Albert Flowers for $1,000, with whom she staid two months and was then sold to John Quinlan, sheriff of Little Rock, for $1,200.With her new master she lived three and a half years, and there was an understanding between them, that she should never be whipped, but her owner seeing her talking to a free colored man one day, became so incensed that he gave her a severe whipping.Soon after this little matinee occur the rebellion came, and at last she heard that northern gun boats were in the river and would protect fugitives who reached them. She ran away, and by hiding during the day and traveling at night, she at last reached, and was taken on board the gun boat Tyler, that was lying at Island No. 3.The next day she was put on a trans-port [transport] and taken to Helena, where she was employed as cook for the officers of Company D, 26th Iowa Infantry, with whom she remained two weeks, and was then employed by Lieutenant Kirkpatrick, who took her to head-quarters [headquarters], where she was installed as cook for the officers of the company commanded by Captain C. V. Gardner, well known in the Hills, in which po-sition [position] she remained three years, and was at Little Rock most of the time, and close to her old master's home.At the close of the war she went to Omaha, and was again married in that city to Hannibal Morris, fifteen years ago, with whom she is now living in this city, arriving here in August, 1876.In this city they are known as Mr. and Mrs. Frenchy. During the many years of her wanderings, thirty-five at least, she never heard a word from her mother or brothers, but has been continually, for the last few years, at-tempting [attempting] to reach them with letters, in Texas, where she understood they had all removed.Two weeks ago a letter of inquiry was sent to "Minister of the Gospel, Sparta, Georgia," and yesterday she received a letter from her mother.

Anderson Banks has returned from Lincoln, Neb., where he was just finished an eight weeks’ visit with his newly found brother In 1857, four years before the opening of the civil war, the father and mother of Mr. Banks, with their twelve children, were the property of Mr. Charles Yancy, a planter who lived near Charlottesville, Va. In that year the owner divided a number of his slaves among his five children, Anderson fell to the lot of a Mr. Taliaferro, who had married one of the Yancys. Madison Banks, another brother, became the property of Dr. Yan-cy [Yancy]. Both Dr. Yancy and Mr. Taliaferro removed to Missouri. One of the sisters went to Macon, Ga., two brothers were sent no one knows where and the rest of the family remained in the old domin-ion [dominion]. Since Taliaferro and Dr. Yancy had gone to different parts of Missouri, An-derson [Anderson] lost sight and knowledge of all except those in Virginia. The war passed, year after year rolled in, but he heard nothing from the lost members of the family whom the institution of slavery had swallowed up. He came to Jacksonville and lived here a number of years. A few weeks ago Wm. Mallory saw upon the street of Lincoln, Nebraska, a man who bore a marked resemblance to his friend in Jacksonville.

Ambrose, of Chicago, then in search for his mother, brothers and sisters, which appeared a few days ago in our columns. The following letter, conveying the glad tiding of the reunion of all the members of the family, will be read with uncommon interest: AUGUST 30, 1865. New Orleans Tribune: I have the pleasure to inform you that Mr. Ambrose Brackens has found his family, including his mother and all her childrens, nine in number, besides sundry new relatives, who by marriage have joined the house of his kindred in their long separation. Mr. Ambrose desires me to thank you in his name for your kindness; which, owing to his leaving for Chicago to-day, he is unable to acknowledge in person as he wished to do. He found his kinsfolks about seventy miles up the Jackson Railroad, in quite a destitute condition, but alive and at work. Brackens, the old master is dead. Mrs. Brackens begged him, her former slave, to take her away to some place of security and plenty. He declined to do so, because Mrs. Brackens had, recently, beaten his old mother until the Prost Marshal had interfered. Upon his mistress, bursting into tears, and exhibiting great distress, Mr. Ambrose gave her some money, and bade her repent and do better!! Mr. Ambrose has provided for the wants of his family, and will soon send for them. The whole story of Mr. Ambrose Brackens will be another chapter in the history of slavery, which history, when written by the colored man himself in the future, will be a contribution to literature, unsurpassed in pathos, incident, daring, fidelity, and endurance in long suffering, and swift and marvellous retribution; and in the almost miraculous redemption of a people from a terrible bondage.

A difficulty is encountered by Mr. Berry, who does not know the address of any officer or seaman on board the Essex at that time. The crew was dismissed, and frequently recruited, and on its discharge from service scattered abroad. A large number of colored men served on the Essex, and if any one of them can aid Officer Berry in securing his deserved pension, it is hoped they will communicate with him at once, directing their letters to Box 341, Houston, Texas.

The story is as follows: "A few years ago, a runaway boy, with his face turned over his shoulder to watch against pursuit, came from the State of Kentucky and slavery to Illinois. He stole away in the night. He stole more than that, for he stole a likely mulatto boy worth a plump thousand dollars. He ignorantly forgot the guards which the Constitution and the laws had set about the sacred institutions of the South. He little reckoned that by his individual act he was swelling the amount of "aggravation," which at its height would induce its possessors to set their end of the national temple on fire. "Ten years from the time when the runaway Kentucky mulatto followed the North star, he began his return journey in broad daylight, in a first class car with his fare paid. The Fugitive Slave law was a forgotten wisp. He journeyed South as leisurely and as much at his ease as the proudest peer of the land, with a full purse and a comfortable bank account to draw upon at home. This slave boy of twelve years ago was now to make a thorough search among the ruins of the fallen prison-house of slavery for the mother and sisters he left behind him in his flight. From that journey he has just returned successful. He visited the lower landings of the Mississippi, patiently followed up every clue he could gain in New Orleans, and at the close of a day's ride a few weeks since, came upon a straggling eastern Louisiana household, and behold, his mother, brothers and sisters stood before him. "The edict of freedom had reached that place, and the freedmen were working by an arrangement with their mistress. The master was dead. He vindictively followed a brother of Mr. Ambrose into the swamps, retook him, but also took cold, lived only to flog him and sell him in Mobile for a haystack of rebel notes, and then turned his face to the wall and died. The whole family were wretchedly poor, and the mistress not too proud to receive a sum of money from her returned runaway. There is but little more to add. Mr. Ambrose, having recovered his family, intends to establish them, at their wish, on a farm near New Madrid, Missouri, according to their preference, although he offered to bring them all to Illinois. It is one of the reunions of families of which there will be many, the fruit of the great manumission."`},{id:4640,title:"Jason McCloud searching for his father Jason, mother Rosa, siblings, wife, and children",related_ads:["Southwestern Christian Advocate (New Orleans, LA)","Anderson, Grimes County, TX","York, SC","Lost Friends Ad"],tags:["child(ren)","estate","estate division","family history","female enslaver","forced migration","former enslaver","master died","parent(s)","sibling(s)","skilled trade","slave trade","slave trader","spouse"],transcription:"DEAR EDITOR—I hope that you can be of assistance to me in looking up my relations whom I left in South Carolina in the year 1856.

February 10--A rather remark-able case of the Enoch Arden order has just cometo light in this city, which is worthy of a detailedmention, and if the parties were of marked socialstanding, would be made highly sensational.Before the breaking out of the war there lived inthis city a colored man named John W. Harper. Ibelieve, upon second thought, he was born here. He fell in love with a dusky maiden named FrankieFrench, and they lived happily together, one childbeing the result of their union. When the warbroke out Harper felt it his duty to shoulder amusket and go into the field to fight forhis country, and first obtaining the consentof his young wife, he enlisted. She never heardfrom him again until the news came that he hadbeen killed in battle and [indecipherable] no word ever reached[2nd image]her ears rebutting this story, time and his silenceseemed to confirm it. Finally, about ten or twelve years ago, a young and industrious colored gen-aleman named John Terrell sued for her hand, andit was accepted and they were married. Sincethen they have lived pleasantly together, with nothought that the former husband would ever ap-pear in their presence this side of the Judgment.This delusion, freighted as it was with joy, wasonly to be dispelled, and who should step into ourcity a few days ago but this identical John W.Harper, all rigged out in a new suit ofregulation blue, typical of the sol-dier of the regular army of the United States. Hedid not come, however, to claim his wife, for he nolonger regarded her as his, for he had long sincelearned that she, acting upon the impression thathe was dead, had married again.

Moreover, helived only two miles from Rock Dan-iel, Tennessee, a village filled withpeople of his own color and noted forsocial functions among the negroelite of the whole country.So our modern Enoch Arden flour-iced until the downfall.[2nd image]Then came the election. Brookswas no sport; but the opportunitieswere rare ones that year. Like ev-ery darkey son of the south, his ten-dencies were distinctly toward Re-publicans: so when a white manof the neighborhood offered to bet asung sum of the alluring metalagainst all that Brooks possessed thatthe election of 1884 would swing to Cleveland, the wager was accepted.It looked like easy money to the fool-ish negro. The entire nation wouldsurely recognize the inherent worthof the grand old party that had struck-en the sheckles from four million suf-fering slaves.  People were too in-telligent to do otherwise in the faceof apparent facts. In addition to thebet, Brooks made the statement: "Ifthis election goes wrong, I'll leavehome and try to forget I ever hadone here."With every feeling of security,Brooks went to the polls and voteda straight ticket. Then he sat down and waited for the returns to comein.They came.

At three, a train wastaking him west."It is all over with me," he said,as the village station with its morn-ing loungers grew dim in the gloom behind the receding coach.

Local gossips hinted contin-ually that there was a woman in thecase. She had not accepted theirversion at first, but as time rolled on,her conditions became such that shewas willing to listen to any reasoningthat pointed to a temporary salvation.As a last resource she consulted alawyer. This man, on receipt of a fee, removed the obstacle, telling herthat under the laws of Tennessee amarriage was null and void after oneparty had absented himself sevenyears, without reporting whether hewas alive or had joined the shades.He, too, was colored, and as the al-leged widow had acquired some smallpittance by dint of hard work, it washe who offered to her, and so the ceremony that made EmmanuelBrooks the Enoch Arden of this tale,was performed.About three months ago Mrs. Jakes,for that as the name she acqiredby the new union, came to KansasCity, Kansas.

Sophy, don't ye know yer husband,George Duncan?"Tears began to gather in the old De-pot woman's eyes, but she held themback a moment, when nature gave wayand gave her old slave husband herhand and bade him 'go see dat ar boy."After the old slave had left the bag-gage room a TIMES reporter took oldAunt Sophia in hand and from herlearned the following interesting factsin the case:THE OLD WOMAN'S STORY.About twenty years ago, she says shewas a slave belonging to Col. ShelbyMartin, a wealthy farmer of Cole county, not far from Jefferson City. Not farfrom her old home there resided a fam-ily by the name of Duncan, who owneda colored boy named George. After abrief courtship George and Sophia weremarried. But George, in his visits toJefferson City, got acquainted with a worthless, degraded woman, and withher started off on the "undergroundrailroad" for Kansas. Sophia livedwith her master until the war set herfree. Her husband recaptured, brought back to Jefferson and sold by his master and was sent to the cottonfields of the South.THE OLD SLAVE'S STORY.George Duncan says he has always re-gretted bitterly his runaway scrape withthe worthless white woman. But when he was betrayed by her when near theKansas line, and was taken back and"sold South," he gave up all hope ofever seeing his wife and children again.He was taken to the cotton fields ofMississippi, and finally transferred toLouisiana, where he has lived for the past eleven years. He says he has been saving money all the time, with a viewto coming North to seek his family, andthis year he says he raised several balesof cotton, the proceeds of which he en-bled him to prosecute his search for his long lost wife and child. He went first to Jefferson City, but found that hiswife disappeared from there during thewar.PROBABLE REUNION.He says he has searched every townalong the Missouri River from KansasCity to Jefferson City, and felt confidenthe would find his family somewhere.He got track of his wife accidentally inconversation with a colored expresswagon driver, who took him to the de-pot and brought the long separated pairtogether. It is not definitely settled inthe mind of the long deserted wifewhether she will take back her truanthusband again. She expressed her mindto a reporter last night in these words:"Don't know yet wedder he's my husban or not. I's got a nice home, a house an' lot an' furniture. which I worked hard for. I's ben workin' in disyere depot nigh on five years, an' I kin gitalong widout George Duncan. I's neb-ber got ober that runnin' away wid datar white woman. 'Sides deres dem gals,hey isn't his'n.""Whose are they, aunty?""Dat's nobody's biznes. Dere's sich ating as folks not gittin' married, ain'tdey? No, sah! I's not made up mymind as dis man ain't a 'poster a tryin'to loose on me."Then old aunty waddled out of thedepot ticket office shaking her head andgrumbling terribly over the prospect of having to take up with her lazy lost husband.`},{id:4949,title:"Unnamed man finds wife remarried",related_ads:["The Kansas City Times (Kansas City, MO)","Information Wanted Ad"],tags:["Enoch Arden","reunion","spouse","white newspaper"],transcription:"A Colored Enoch Arden.A black man and woman were at thestation last night, making fulsome com-plaints to Capt.

That the good BayState first introduced slavery intothis country, found it unprofitable,sold their slaves South, and thensang the doxology through to longmetre, thanking God they were notas other men, is not the most inter-esting instance of the Yankee spiritwhich first taught that it is "a goodthink to be shifty in a new coun-try."There is this day living at Wino-na, Miss., a thriving little city onthe Illinois Central Railroad, onePeyton Hemingway, well known tothe writer hereof from boyhood.Peyton is a ginger-bread fellow,very active for his age, and wasfor many years before the war thechief fiddler at the big balls givenin all the country around aboutamong the hills and valleys of Car-roll, Sunflower and adjoining coun-ties. In 1861 he went as body ser-vant to the theatre of war in Vir-ginia with his young master, Hon.W. L. Herrington of the EleventhMississippi Regiment. at presentMississippi's State Treasurer. Heremained faithful to the end, and after the surrender of Lee andJohnston and the general scatter-meant of all the Southern troops,white, black, and blue, (the blue [2nd image]predominating) Peyton was pickedup by the advance guard of Grant'sand Sherman's deliverers. Two orthree of these sons of Freedomsoon spirited Peyton on to thecoast where for $500 paid by the agent of a Cuban planter he wasshipped off in chains to the Queenof the Antilles all the same as ifsuch a thing as "shouting the bat-tle cry of freedom" had never been sung in the camp where were as-sembled the hosts of the Lord's children.Arrived in Cuba, once more aslave, Peyton toiled in de cottonan' de cane from May, 1865 to 1880---a period of fifteen years, whichto this colored Enoch Arden, whohad left wife and children behindin Carroll county, Mississippi, seem-ed as many centuries. His variousattempts to escape subjected himto hard discipline at the hands of his new master. Finally, in the year 1880, he found a friend inneed who secreted him in the holdof a vessel bound for New York.He was a long time working hisway South. One morning, howev-er, the crowd gathered about thedepot at Winona saw a gentlemanbound in yellow step from the train;a large, fat "aunty" gathered himin her arms and in the joyouswrestling both hugger and hugeefelt the red dirt on the lofty em-bankment slide from under theirfeet, whereupon the long separatedpair rolled in each other's duskyarms down the steep decline, theirchildren on top of them utteringwhat the darkeys call "loud lamen-tations ob joy."[3rd image]During the husband's fifteenyears' absence, his wife, like everyone else, thinking him dead, hadmarried again and become a widow---so that the wedding bells were inno respect "jangled, out of tune and harsh" when the long lost put in his appearance.Peyton saw sights and heardsounds and witnessed the Wallapusin most romantic and remarkableattitudes during his enforced exile.He says that, immediately after thewar, many a confiding colored manand woman were cajoled off by the blue coated bummers, and sold in-to Cuban slavery. He reports thata number of gay Lotharios who hadmarched with Sherman to the seaand gyrated around with Grant, wooed, won and wedded each a wife of African descent, took herlovingly on a bridal tour to Havannah, delivered her over to theslave owner for many pieces of sil-ver, and left there in bondage toweep the absence of he recreantlord in tears that the hot savan-nahs of the far-off isle drank downin plenteous draught.Such is the simple story as knownto thousands in North and CentralMississippi.

The readerhas the story; if any doubt of itsrealism may linger in his mind aletter of inquiry addressed to anyone at Winona, Mississippi, willreceive prompt attention and cor-roboration.
